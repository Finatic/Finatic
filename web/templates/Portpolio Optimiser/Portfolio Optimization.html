    <h1>Portfolio Optimization</h1>
    <p>
        This portfolio optimizer tool supports the following portfolio optimization strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mean Variance Optimization &ndash; Find the optimal risk adjusted portfolio that lies on the efficient
            frontier
        </li>
        <li>
            Minimize Conditional Value-at-Risk &ndash; Optimize the portfolio to minimize the expected tail loss
        </li>
        <li>
            Risk Parity &ndash; Find the portfolio that equalizes the risk contribution of portfolio assets
        </li>
        <li>
            Minimize Tracking Error &ndash; Find the portfolio that minimizes the tracking error against the
            selected benchmark
        </li>
        <li>
            Maximize Information Ratio &ndash; Find the portfolio that maximizes the information ratio against the
            selected benchmark
        </li>

        <li>
            Maximize Kelly Criterion &ndash; Finds the portfolio with the maximum expected geometric growth rate
        </li>
        <li>
            Maximize Sortino Ratio &ndash; Find the portfolio that maximizes the Sortino ratio for the given minimum
            acceptable return
        </li>
        <li>
            Maximize Omega Ratio &ndash; Find the portfolio that maximizes the Omega ratio for the given minimum
            acceptable return
        </li>
        <li>
            Minimize Maximum Drawdown &ndash; Find the portfolio with the minimum worst case drawdown with optional
            minimum acceptable return
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The optimization is based on the monthly return statistics of the selected portfolio assets for the given
        time period.
        The optimization result does not predict what allocation would perform best outside the given time period,
        and the actual performance
        of portfolios constructed using the optimized asset weights may vary from the given performance goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The required inputs for the optimization include the time range and the portfolio assets. Portfolio asset
        weights and constraints are optional.
        You can also use the <a href="black-litterman-model"><strong>Black-Litterman model</strong> </a> based portfolio
        optimization,
        which allows the benchmark portfolio asset weights to be optimized based on investor's views.
    </p>
